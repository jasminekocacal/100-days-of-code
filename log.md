# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: EXAMPLE

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on refamiliarizing myself with java. Started a fridge project with user registration, fridge registration, food insertion, etc. Thinking of adding JDBC so that I can have some storage. 

**Thoughts**: I've forgotten a lot of syntax. It was good to start up again.
