### Day 1: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on refamiliarizing myself with java. Started a fridge project with user registration, fridge registration, food insertion, etc. Thinking of adding JDBC so that I can have some storage. 

**Thoughts**: I've forgotten a lot of syntax. It was good to start up again.

### Day 2: November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do much work on my app but I started adding some more parts like log4j and postgres. Spent a lot of time figuring out how to install and integrate them. 

**Thoughts:** I feel a little silly because I forgot that maven does most of the work for you. It was a little frustrating to look for info and find conflicting information. I hope to get more actual coding done next time.
